# ARM_Projects-NTI
This repository provides the complete Micro-Controller Abstraction Layer (MCAL) of the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller, based upon ARM Cortex M3, covering all built-in peripherals. A Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) accompanies, built upon the MCAL, and provides interfaces to many useful device modules.
